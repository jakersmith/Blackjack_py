# This is the development plan for Blackjack game

1. Requirements:
    Create a game of blackjack between the user and computer
    No bets below $5, bet everything if account is less than $5, no betting more than account
    Allow game to play until user quits or account is zero

2. System Analysis:
    INPUTS: bet amount; hit/stay; play again
    OUTPUTS: proper execution of game; account adjusted for bet; play again/quit
3. System design:
    Create a class for the game
        methods
            play game: loop all other methods in order;
                       exit loop if player quit of account is zero
            betting: allow players to enter bets
            deal cards: deal two cards to the player and dealer, alternating
            player turn: display player's hand and second card of dealer;
                         allow player to hit/stay, add cards to hand;
                         exit if bust (player over 21) and subtract bet from account
            dealer turn: display dealer's hand;
                         hit if dealer is below 17;
                         exit and bust if dealer over 21
            determine winner: if either player busts, the other wins;
                              if player is greater than dealer add bet to account;
                              if player is equal to dealer no winner;
                              if player is less than dealer subtract bet from account
4. Implementation:

5. Testing:
    Test each method individually to ensure they work on their own
    Test methods together (gradually) to ensure they work together
    Test final program
        betting when appropriate
        hits can be input and calculated
        winnings properly calculated
        play again runs properly
